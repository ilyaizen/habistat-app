Tauri ships with a default iconset based on its logo. This is NOT what you want when you ship your application. To remedy this common situation, Tauri provides the icon command that will take an input file ("./app-icon.png" by default) and create all the icons needed for the various platforms.

`bun run tauri icon app-icon.png`
